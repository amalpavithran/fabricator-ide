# Fabricator IDE

Fabricator IDE helps you create apps using a new and simple sub-bot (node) based GUI way!

## Setting Up Fabricator IDE (on Debian/Ubuntu)

Setting up the IDE is Simple -

### 1. You must have `npm` and `nodejs` installed.

For Windows, install them from the link:
https://nodejs.org/

To install the required packages on ubuntu/debian, run -
```
sudo apt install nodejs
```
To install the required packages on new verions of fedora/RHEL/CentOS, run -
```
sudo dnf install nodejs
```

To install the required packages on older verions of fedora/RHEL/CentOS, run -
```
sudo yum install nodejs
```

### 2. Now to install the required NodeJs packages (`electron` that is)

Run the following -
```
npm install
```

Now npm would automatically install the required packages

### 3. To Run the IDE

Final step -
```
npm start
```

The Fabricator IDE should now launch!
